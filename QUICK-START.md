# Integra OS - Quick Start Guide

## Building the Server Package

Run this single command:

\`\`\`bash
npm run build-server
\`\`\`

This will create a folder called `integra-os-server` with everything you need.

## Deploying

1. Copy the `integra-os-server` folder to your server computer
2. Double-click `START-INTEGRA-OS.bat`
3. Access from any browser at `http://server-ip:3001`

## Updating

When you make changes:

1. Run `npm run build-server` again
2. Copy the new `integra-os-server` folder to your server
3. Restart the server

That's it! Everyone gets the update instantly.

## No Installation Needed

Users just open their browser and go to the server address. No software to install on their computers.
